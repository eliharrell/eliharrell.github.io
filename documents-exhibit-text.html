			    <b>DOCUMENTS</b>
			</p>
			<p>
			    This exhibition was born from a desire to share what we see as a special
			    moment in Doc’s print history. While in the past, our calendars and film
			    formats were hardly unique, but the largely digital nature of information
			    today has rendered us conscious of the particular strengths of physical
			    media. Print—both on paper and on celluloid—remains a site of innovation
			    here at Doc.
			</p>
			<p>
			    This particular chapter of Doc’s print and design history, in which a new
			    Doc identity was cemented, is closed by the end of Design Chair Eli
			    Harrell’s three years at Doc, in which he debuted a new logo, experimented
			    with all aspects of Doc’s calendar, and fostered a practice of creativity
			    with all of Doc’s print materials—passes, booklets, single screening
			    posters, large-scale advertisements, and more. These documents highlight a
			    functionality brought on by certain factors unique to Doc’s identity,
			    namely, that Doc is a student-run, community-oriented organization. Doc
			    calendars are displayed on many a dorm room wall and are used by our loyal
			    patrons, as well as appearing on our newsletter or on social media. Some of
			    these more recent documents, like the folded brochure-style calendar of Fall
			    2023 and Winter 2024, reflect a creative adaptation to Doc’s recent limited
			    financial situation. Others reflect an attempt to bring audiences back to
			    the theaters, like the large white and black posters that briefly occupied
			    campus walls and more successfully and humorously captured student attention
			    than an Instagram post.
			</p>
			<p>
			    We also turn to other calendars and documents from the 1980s to the present.
			    Some of these pre-date digital promotion and are designed in a different
			    context than today. On display through these materials are some of the
			    programming of the last few decades, with notably more celluloid prints
			    pre-2010. The shift away from print, then, is one that affects not only Doc
			    but the larger area of cinema.
			</p>
			<p>
			    DOCUMENTS is largely a celebration of our commitment to print and physical
			    media, but also a celebration and reflection on the changing, but
			    increasingly integral role of print material to our operations, identity,
			    and success. The world may be changing, but Doc’s prints are here to stay.

			    <b>The ‘Doc 90’ Logo</b>
			</p>
			<p>
			    Like so much else in this world, Doc Films evades obvious definition: though
			    our earliest screenings were documentaries on film (it was 1932), our cinema
			    now shows just about any moving image under the sun. In what sense, then,
			    are we still ‘Doc’? And for that matter, what sets us apart? Could it be our
			    top-notch programming? Our rock-bottom prices? Our state-of-the-art cinema?
			    Our legion admirers? In 2022, when we celebrated our 90th anniversary, all
			    of these questions came to a head. A new visual identity was in order.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Sketches reveal the difficult accommodation of graphic punch with textual
			    legibility. Initially, I thought to frame each letter as if it were printed
			    on a film strip, but the gridlike results lacked a compelling composition
			    that would catch the eye <i>and</i> keep it. Experiments with spacing and
			    font did little to improve this still-middling logotype. However, more
			    experimentation led to the circular shape, and additional iterations and a
			    precise geometric treatment resulted in the one-piece form we now use.
			    Although still speculative, a reel of this shape could be built, though it
			    would likely end our relationships with distributors if it were to find its
			    way into the projection booth…
			</p>
			<p>
			    This logo elevates ‘Doc’ from an internal term of endearment to our public
			    face. While film is what brought us together, and film is still central to
			    our mission, Doc has become more than just celluloid: it is an organic,
			    decades-old community that continues to foster and maintain connections
			    across the university, Hyde Park, Chicago, and the world. We like to call
			    ourselves ‘Doc,’ and with this logo, we invite you to as well—now, and for
			    the next ninety years.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p id="writing">
			    <b>Writing the Calendar</b>
			</p>
			<p>
			    Every quarter in anticipation of the upcoming season of films, the Board
			    dons the hat of a print publication and becomes an editorial team. Notably,
			    Doc is one of the few remaining institutions (not only as a movie theater,
			    but as a student organization) that writes its own copy and does much, if
			    not all, of its own design. Calendar capsules are written by programmers,
			    and then edited to perfection by the board: we check every word, comma,
			    italicized film title. The process is laborious and requires many rounds of
			    edits, PDF drafts, and phone calls between the General Chair and the Design
			    Chair to ensure an (almost) perfect suite of copy that totals over 10,000
			    words. This highlights the importance of the print calendar as a document:
			    it holds a certain type of finality and legitimacy that an easily editable
			    digital document does. During the weeks in which the calendar is put
			    together, there are often debates about legibility, functionality, identity.
			    Questions about details are ubiquitous:
			    <i>
			        Should we include a column for repeat screenings?
			    </i>
			    and <i>Should the format or runtime appear first?</i> Every quarter, without
			    fail, there is a furious rush to meet the print production deadline. But few
			    things feel as good as holding and reading a physical copy of Doc’s
			    programing. Though screenings are ephemeral, the calendar is a tangible
			    realization of our months of planning; of our long-awaited dreams.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p id="printing">
			    <b>Print Then, Print Now</b>
			</p>
			<p>
			    Print has been around for centuries, but as old as Doc is, you will not find
			    any incunabula here. Rather, for most of Doc’s print history, the offset
			    press was how we produced our calendars and other ephemera. An offset press
			    is an immense machine composed of a sequence of subunits which each transfer
			    one color of ink to the paper, as it passes between their rollers in a
			    continuous motion. Only once all the colors have been applied is the long
			    sheet cut to size. Because each subunit requires its own maintenance and
			    color of ink, it was common practice at Doc and in most print materials of
			    the 20th century to use a limited number of colors in print design, often
			    just one or two (monotone or duotone)—this reduced the number of different
			    “plates,” or ink stencils, that the production facility had to make, and
			    also reduced the amount of setup required for the offset press. This economy
			    of color is clearly visible in most of Doc’s printed materials before the
			    late 2000s, when full digital multicolor printing became equally (if not
			    more) economical than the older ink-centric technology.
			</p>
			<p>
			    This shift coincides with the relocation of Doc’s print production from
			    Printer’s Row in South Loop to Skokie, just west of Evanston. Before this
			    relocation, recalled former Design Chair Luke Joyner, it was normal to visit
			    the factory and learn the production process so that print materials would
			    be designed with attention to the nuances of paper, ink, and machinery. This
			    intimate relationship is especially clear in the subtle duotones of many Doc
			    calendars from the past, where contrast and tonal range were used to their
			    fullest to produce legible text on top of images meant to be seen from afar.
			    Just as Doc teaches the art of film projection and handling, it once also
			    taught how to interface and respond directly to the material conditions of a
			    factory environment. This winter, Design Chair Eli Harrell and incoming Ines
			    Kang toured the facility of Grace Printing, our current producer, in Skokie,
			    meeting the people, machines, and supplies which make our documents
			    possible. Though brief, this trip reignited our passion for the bilateral
			    craft of the industrial graphic arts, of which Doc is proud to be a
			    part—then and now.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p id="folding">
			    <b>Folding Economics</b>
			</p>
			<p>
			    When money is short, it’s best to make do with less. But here at Doc, this
			    is not enough: we did more with less. In recent history, Doc has produced a
			    booklet alongside its wall-sized calendar. This booklet, some of which
			    appear here, contained essays written by programmers which outline the
			    themes and motivations for each series, as well as images, which usually do
			    not fit on the calendar due to the volume of text allotted to capsules. In
			    the fall of 2023, we tried something new: print on both sides, and make a
			    single program that does double duty: calendar on one side, booklet on the
			    other. Part of the charm of the booklet is the ability to flip pages, so
			    that each series appears to stand alone: just its screenings, its images,
			    and its essay are visible in a given glance. Through a back-and-forth with
			    our production at Grace Printing, we were able to determine a page size that
			    would fit the entire calendar on one side while also being able to be folded
			    in their special machine to create the “accordion” shape that enables
			    page-flipping and a width perfect for a back pocket. Meeting all of the
			    constraints for this folded design was a tall order, but it resulted in a
			    dynamic design that can take on many different forms, from broadsheet to
			    booklet to fan! Though this innovation initially saved on printing costs, it
			    proved so popular that we had to make an unprecedented reorder. Read
			    carefully, and you might just be able to tell whether a given Fall 2023
			    program is an original or a reprint…
			</p>

			<p id="team">
			    <b>Design Team and Posternauts</b>
			</p>
			<p>
			    While posters adorn many of the surfaces of campus and greater Hyde Park,
			    few appear as rigorously as Doc’s. Promoting screenings has been a perennial
			    concern for Doc, and yet as any marketing executive will tell you, OOH (Out
			    Of Home) advertising remains a major player despite and because of the
			    digital sphere. While online advertisements are universally considered a
			    nuisance, we at Doc like to think that our promotion materials are works of
			    art. As such, our Design Team works closely with the Design Chair to produce
			    materials that are up to snuff: accurate, original, and striking is the
			    goal. Posternauts, who report to the Publicity Chair, arrive each Sunday to
			    receive their packet of pre-printed posters, which they post wherever foot
			    traffic is densest, and eyes the wandering-est—just check out Cobb Hall.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Although we use digital promotion to reach a wider audience than our
			    Posternauts are capable of getting to, their work with the Design Team
			    speaks to our larger organizational commitment to print. While digital
			    promotion can come from anywhere at any time, print requires manpower and
			    old-fashioned logistics, which form the basis of any good community: there
			    are deadlines to meet, expectations to exceed, and altogether a lot of
			    communication. Talking to each other about print means talking to each
			    other, and talking to each other makes Doc what it is: a community.
